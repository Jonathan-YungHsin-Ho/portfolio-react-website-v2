					<p>
						After over a decade working with students of all ages in both public
						and independent school settings, I decided to embrace a new
						challenge and expand my skills in a different direction. I joined
						the field of computer programming, particularly web development,
						because I thoroughly enjoy flexing the logical reasoning and
						problem-solving muscles required to bring a coding project to
						completion.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I'm a fast thinker, learner, and doer, adept at building on my prior
						knowledge and seeking resources to address any gaps in my current
						understanding. Additionally, the communication and collaboration
						skills I've developed over my career as an educator, as well as the
						flexibility and adaptability that comes from working with diverse
						groups of people, including my students and other educators, are
						strengths that I bring with me to all my pursuits. I'm always
						learning and growing, and I'm excited to apply all that I've done
						and learned toward finding solutions for real-world problems.
